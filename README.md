# Music_Player
The first step is to choose a Python GUI framework

Here we will use two main GUI libraries for creating a music player with Python:

1)Pygame
2)Tkinter
Pygame is a Python library used to create video games. To create a music player with Python, we will be using the Pygame sound component.

Tkinter is a library for creating GUI applications. Here we don’t need to use much functions of it we just need to use the askdirectory() method of Tkinter and other methods that we will see in the code section.

Then we will create functions such as play, stop, pause and resume in order to control the music player. To create these commands, we’ll build some functions and we’ll use Tkinter to create the button in the interface.

We are now going to implement all of the steps above in the section below to create a music player with Python.
